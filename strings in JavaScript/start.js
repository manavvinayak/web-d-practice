// To find length of string
console.log("Amazon".length)

const str = "I am a string";
const len = str.length;
console.log(len)
// Note that space is also counted in a string
// Although string values are primitive JavaScript types, some properties and methods can be applied to them just as if they were objects by using the dot notation. length is one of those properties.
