//  Classes
// A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have.

// Mnemonic: Think of a class as a "Cookie Cutter" that shapes cookies (objects).

// Objects
// An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the blueprint provided by the class and has its own set of properties and methods.

// Mnemonic: Think of an object as a "Cookie" made from the cookie cutter (class).

// Most object-oriented languages use classes as abstractions for the ideas or concepts manipulated by a program. A class is used to create objects representing a concept. It offers a convenient syntax to give both data and behavior to these objects. JavaScript is no exception and supports programming with classes (but with a twist â€” more on that later).
